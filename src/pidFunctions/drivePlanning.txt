1. Get current Postion
    a.To get this we need to find out how much the robot rotated
    b. we need to know how much the bot moved up and down
    c. We need to use imu to find the drift value

    Combinding these we can find where we are
2. Put in desired Postion
3. Find most effective pathway to get to that location
    Using the current location bot should shortet route to new location
    This will require odemtry and motion planning

4. Need to be accurate
    Should be feild centric so if it made a mistake earier it can fix it
